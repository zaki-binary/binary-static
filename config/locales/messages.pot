msgid "\"Binary\" or \"digital\" options are options that pay a pre-determined, fixed amount, depending on whether or not an event occurs at the time the Binary Option expires. Binary Options can have only one of two possible outcomes and allow you to take a simple \"Yes or No\" approach. Like traditional options, Binary Options are based on an underlying asset such as currencies, commodities, indexes or stocks, however one of the most significant differences from traditional options, among others, is that there can be only two outcomes for the option, either the client is paid the return upon the occurrence of the event, or the client loses the investment amount as determined in each option."

Unlike real market stock indices whose prices depend on the prices of the individual stocks listed on an Exchange, the random stock index only relies on factors like volatility, previous index price (previous simulated price) and a random number to determine the price of the index. Due to the use of random numbers, the price (or direction) of the index cannot be predicted with certainty and thus behaves like a real market index. When the index is appended with a number, the number is the percentage volatility used in calculating the index price. For instance, the Random Index 25 uses a volatility of 25% in the calculation of the index price. The index started at 1000 on 16 May 2004."
