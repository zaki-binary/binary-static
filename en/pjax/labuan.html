Its name comes from the Malay word, &#x27;labuhan&#x27; which means harbour. Formerly a part of the Brunei Sultanate, it was ceded to the British Crown in 1846, before joining Malaysia in 1963.</p><p>Today, Labuan is known as a flourishing financial centre and tax-free tourist destination. Its economy is driven primarily by its oil and gas resources, as well as its international investment and banking services. The latter has attracted thousands of companies to Labuan over the years, plus dozens of leading banks.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="living fill-bg-color"><div class="container gr-row gr-padding-30 center-text"><div class="gr-12 gr-padding-20 center-text"><h2>Living in Labuan</h2></div><div class="gr-12"><div class="container center-text"><div><div id="image_slider" class="image-slider gr-row gr-row-align-center invisible"><div id="go_back" class="align-self-center gr-1"><img src="/binary-static/images/pages/home/arrow_left.svg"/></div><div class="gr-10 no-scroll"><ul id="slider_wrapper" class="slider-wrapper"><li class="slider-image invisible"><img class="responsive" src="/binary-static/images/pages/careers/labuan/island-paradise.jpg"/><div class="image-caption"><p>Living on an island paradise has its perks.
