Trading cryptocurrency contracts for differences is highly speculative investment because prices of cryptocurrencies can go up and down &mdash; potentially to a worthless (zero) value. Investing in cryptocurrency contracts for differences through leveraged accounts amplifies this underlying volatility risk, making the change in prices even more significant. When you invest in a leveraged contract for differences related to cryptocurrencies, your profit or loss is based on the leveraged ratio you set for your account. If the price movement is in your favour, returns generated are of multiple times higher than the amount set aside from your account balance to open and maintain a transaction. However, if the price movement is against your favour, you will suffer losses that are of multiple times higher than the amount set aside from your account balance to open and maintain a transaction. You should not trade in cryptocurrencies unless you fully understand and are aware that trades and / or investments involving cryptocurrencies are complex and high risk in nature and you not only risk incurring significant losses over a short period of time but also risk losing all your invested capital."

However, investments that have the potential to deliver greater investment returns carry higher levels of risk. This means that if the price movement is against your favour, you will suffer losses that are of multiple times higher than the amount set aside from your account balance to open and maintain a transaction (your margin)."
msgstr "槓桿可以用於生成比從您的帳戶餘額撥出進行開盤持倉交易（您的保證金）的金額高出多倍的回報。然而，進行可能帶來更大投資回報的投資具更高風險。這意味著，如果價格走勢對您不利，您將蒙受比從您的帳戶餘額撥出進行開盤持倉交易（您的保證金）的金額高出多倍的虧損。"

msgid "Leverage, in the context of margin trading, refers to the use of margin to increase/amplify the value of a trade. Leverage is expressed as a ratio. A 50:1 leverage, for example, means that you would be able to enter into a trade position that is of 50 times higher than your margin. When you invest in a leveraged product, your profit or loss is based on the leveraged position, i.e., the increased/amplified value of your trade determined based on the leverage ratio you set for your account."
msgstr "融資融券交易中，槓桿指使用保證金增加/擴大交易數值。槓桿的表達方式是比率。舉個例子，如果槓桿是50: 1，您將能夠持有比保證金高出 50 倍的交易頭寸。當您投資一種槓桿產品時，您的盈利或虧損將根據槓桿的頭寸計算，也就是說，您為帳戶設定的槓桿比率決定了您的交易增加/擴大數值。"
