Investing in cryptocurrency contracts for differences through leveraged accounts amplifies this underlying volatility risk, making the change in prices even more significant. When you invest in a leveraged contract for differences related to cryptocurrencies, your profit or loss is based on the leveraged ratio you set for your account. If the price movement is in your favour, returns generated are of multiple times higher than the amount set aside from your account balance to open and maintain a transaction. However, if the price movement is against your favour, you will suffer losses that are of multiple times higher than the amount set aside from your account balance to open and maintain a transaction. You should not trade in cryptocurrencies unless you fully understand and are aware that trades and / or investments involving cryptocurrencies are complex and high risk in nature and you not only risk incurring significant losses over a short period of time but also risk losing all your invested capital."

msgid "Leverage can be used to generate returns that are of multiple times higher than the amount set aside from your account balance to open and maintain a transaction (your margin). However, investments that have the potential to deliver greater investment returns carry higher levels of risk. This means that if the price movement is against your favour, you will suffer losses that are of multiple times higher than the amount set aside from your account balance to open and maintain a transaction (your margin)."

A 50:1 leverage, for example, means that you would be able to enter into a trade position that is of 50 times higher than your margin. When you invest in a leveraged product, your profit or loss is based on the leveraged position, i.e., the increased/amplified value of your trade determined based on the leverage ratio you set for your account."
