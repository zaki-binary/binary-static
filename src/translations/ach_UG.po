When you invest in a leveraged contract for differences related to cryptocurrencies, your profit or loss is based on the leveraged ratio you set for your account. If the price movement is in your favour, returns generated are of multiple times higher than the amount set aside from your account balance to open and maintain a transaction. However, if the price movement is against your favour, you will suffer losses that are of multiple times higher than the amount set aside from your account balance to open and maintain a transaction.

In such cases, the automatic margin close-out protection might fail, causing your account balance to fall below zero. For this purpose, a Negative Balance Protection mechanism has been introduced. Negative Balance Protection provides a ‘backstop’ in case of extreme market conditions and ensures that your maximum losses from trading CFDs, including all related costs, are limited to the balance available on your CFD account. Therefore, you can never lose more money than the total sum invested for trading CFDs; if your CFD account balance falls below zero, the Company will compensate the negative balance as soon as possible without any additional cost to you."
