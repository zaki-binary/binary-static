Binary-Static 
=============

This repository contains the static HTML, Javascript, CSS, and images content of the [Binary.com](http://www.binary.com) website.

## Installation

In order to work on your own version of the Binary.com Javascript and CSS, please **fork this project**.

You will also need to install the following on your development machine:

- Ruby, RubyGems
- Sass (`sudo gem install sass`)
- Node.js (10.14.2 or higher is recommended) and NPM (see <https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/>)
- Go to project root, then run `npm install`
- Grunt (`sudo npm install -g grunt-cli`)

### Use a custom domain
In order to use your custom domain, please put it in a file named `CNAME` inside `scripts` folder of your local clone of binary-static.


How to work with this project
=============================

### Deploy to your gh-pages for the first time

1. Register your application [here](https://developers.binary.com/applications/). This will give you the ability to redirect back to your github pages after login.
Use `https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/binary-static/en/logged_inws.html` for the Redirect URL and `https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/binary-static/en/redirect.html` for the Verification URL.

    If you're using a custom domain, replace the github URLs above with your domain.

2. In `src/javascript/config.js`: Insert the `Application ID` of your registered application in `user_app_id`.
  * **NOTE:** In order to avoid accidentally committing personal changes to this file, use `git update-index --assume-unchanged src/javascript/config.js`

3. Run `grunt dev`


### Deploy js/css and template changes together

```
grunt dev
```


### Deploy only js/css changes

```
grunt deploy
```


### Deploy some template changes

```
grunt dev --path=about-us
```


### Using sub-folders
There are times that you are working on various branches at the same time, and you want to deploy/test each branch separately on your gh-pages, you can simply use `--branch=branchname` for grunt commands:
- `grunt dev --branch=branchname`
This will deploy your changes to a sub-folder named: `br_branchname` and it can be browsed at: https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/binary-static/br_branchname/

In order to remove the created folders from your gh-pages, you can use either:
- `grunt dev --cleanup`: removes all `br_*` folders and deploys to the root folder.

  or
- `grunt shell:remove_folder --folder=br_branchname1,br_branchname2,...`: only removes the specified folder(s) from your gh-pages.

### Preview on your local machine
- To preview your changes locally, run `sudo grunt serve`
- It will watch for js/css changes and rebuild on every change you make.
- To test changes made to templates, you need to re-compile them:
  - `grunt shell:compile_dev` to re-compile all templates.
  - `grunt shell:compile_dev --path=about-us` to re-compile only template(s) which serve about-us path in URL.
- To fix eslint errors run `npm run eslint`

### Sections
The codebase is divided into different sections. Passing `--section=[all|app|app_2]` to almost all grunt commands causes to run it on the specified section (excluding tests since it should run on the whole source code).

Current sections are:
- `app` represents current version of the website including `app`, `static`, `landing_pages` folders in the source code.
- `app_2` is the next version which its source code is mainly inside the `app_2` folders.
- `all` denotes to all available sections and is the default value if `--section` is not specified.

Although section is mandatory for release, but it is optional for the rest of commands as there is a default value (`all`).

## Release

```
grunt release --{release type}=1 --section=app|app_2 [--cleanup] [--reset]
```
(The value is needed when more than one option is used)

### Parameters:
- `{release type}` (mandatory)
  - Should be one of `staging`, `production`, `translations`, `nex_beta`, `nex_production`.
  - In order to prevent accidentally releasing to the wrong target, it is mandatory to provide one of these parameters.
  - Your remote origin will be checked to be the correct target of the given parameter.
  - Your current branch will be checked to be the correct branch of the given parameter.
- `--section` (mandatory)
  - In order to prevent mistakes during the release, it is mandatory to specify the section.
  - Valid section depends on the release target. Please refer to `release_config` [here](https://github.com/binary-com/binary-static/blob/new-app/build/config/constants.js).
- `--cleanup` [optional]
  - Create CNAME file with proper value according to remote origin
  - Deploy to gh-pages with the option `add: false`
- `--reset` [optional]
  - Removes all commits from `gh-pages` branch before release (staging only)
